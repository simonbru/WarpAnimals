# WarpAnimals

Mod for Stardew Valley that allows warping wandering farm animals into their
respective home.

## Use cases

* Animals normally go home by themselves at dusk, but sometimes they don't for some reason and they'll be unfairly grumpy the next day.

* You forgot to close the gates the day before and don't want to go retrieve every animal on your farm.

## Installation

* Install [SMAPI 2.11.2 or later](https://smapi.io/).

* [Download](https://github.com/simonbru/WarpAnimals/releases) and unzip this mod into `Stardew Valley/Mods`.

## Usage

Press `K` to warp animals. It is possible to configure the key or gamepad button in `config.json`. Set the key to `null` to disable the shortcut.

There is also a console command `warp_animals` in case you don't want to reserve a key just for this.

## Notes

Source code is [on GitHub](https://github.com/simonbru/WarpAnimals).

You may want to check [AutoAnimalDoors](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1019/?) if you don't want to manage the animal doors at all. This will also warp your animals automatically if needed.
